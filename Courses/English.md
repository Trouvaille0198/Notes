# Summary

This report wrote by Maddy Savage mainly explains why Swedes avoid discussing money in the effect of Jantelagen. Jantelagen, a traditional rule that discourages people to show themselves off and keeps everybody equal, especially the wealth part, makes talking about money a forbiddance in most Nordic regions. This mechanism maybe less pronounced among the same class. Nevertheless, the voice against Jantelagen has become a common phenomenon among youngsters, due to the push of Individualism and the generalized bragging on social media. In addition, Immigration boom has also eliminated Jantelagen’ s impact.

Jantelagen keeps the society more stable and minimizes the stress of life from income levels. But it also makes the whole society conservative. People would not be proud of how much money they earn, thus reducing the passion to fight for success. Efforts need to be recognized public, too much modesty will only lead to depression and negativity. Jantelagen demonstrates the Swedish tradition of low-profile behavior and not comparing. However, we need more encouragement form others and society to move forward.

Biden says 'no time to waste' for Senate to pass his Covid relief package

President Joe Biden called on the US Senate to take "quick action" in passing his $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, speaking just hours after House Democrats approved his first legislative priority.

"We have no time to waste. If we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus. We can finally get our economy moving again, and the people of this country have suffered far too much for too long," Biden said Saturday morning in brief remarks from the White House. "We need to relieve that suffering."
The President spoke about the importance of passing the pandemic aid package and the pivotal role it will play in scaling up vaccination efforts and school re-openings.
"With their vote, we're one step closer to vaccinating the nation. We are one step closer to putting \$1,400 in the pockets of Americans. We are one step closer to extending the unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who are shortly going to lose them," Biden said.
He continued, "We are one step closer to helping millions of Americans feed their families and keep a roof over their head. We're one step closer getting our kids safely back in school. We are one step closer to getting state and local governments the money they need to prevent massive layoffs for essential workers."
Biden also thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with whom he said he spoke with "just a few moments ago," for her "extraordinary leadership."
The House approved Biden's Covid relief package early Saturday morning along party lines by a vote of 219-212, sending the bill to the Senate. It passed with no Republican support.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, railed against House Democrats in a statement Saturday for passing the legislation without any bipartisan support and accused them of having "jammed through a bill that even liberal economists and editorial boards say is not well targeted to this stage of the fight."
The Senate is expected to strip out a provision in the legislation increasing the federal minimum wage after the Senate parliamentarian ruled against including it under the procedure known as reconciliation, which Senate Democrats are using to pass the bill with a simple majority vote.
The bill would then head back to the House for a separate vote before it reaches Biden's desk to be signed into law.
During an annual Black History Month celebration on Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris thanked Democratic leadership for passing the Covid-relief package and argued that the bill would benefit the Black community, who has been among the hardest hit groups during the pandemic.
The package advanced by House Democrats includes ​\$1,400 direct checks to Americans making less than $75,000 annually, direct aid to small businesses, direct funding to state and local governments, funding for schools and more money for vaccine distribution.
This story has been updated with additional developments Saturday.



summary

President Joe Biden put pressure on the US senate about agreeing the passage of his Covid relief bill. In the speech made after his legislative priority being passed early Saturday morning, Biden emphasized on the significance of the pandemic aid package, calling on the senate to vote for his package and thanked House Speaker for support. However, due to no Republican supporting the legislation during the House Vote, House Democrats are under criticism from Senate Minority. Meanwhile there're also comments from black community in favor of the Covid-relief package. The bill will not be signed until it is voted by House individually.



comment

\$1.9 trillion Covid relief bill sounds great, but it was passed so successfully without any House Republican's support, which made people wonder about the foul played by Democrats. It's become customary for celebrities to talk in one way and act in another, which greatly reduce the credibility of so called "politicians".
