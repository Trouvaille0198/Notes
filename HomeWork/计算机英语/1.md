This article tells about how to solve coding problems in a four-steps way. It really helps me because problem solving is an important indicator in a job interview.

Recognize the issue. Although job interview won't give you much time to think, you still need to fully understand the issue before solving.

Make a strategy. Strategy is a kind of plan before coding. There are several ways to design a strategy. Pseudo-code seems a good choice for me. "consider systematically how a human solves the problem." this principle helps me a lot.

Execute the plan. This is a core part of solving, the step needs you to write actual code. The author offers a useful skill: Ignore the difficult part of the problem that you don't understand for the time being and write out the other parts.	

Take a look back. Examining your code is a essential step. You should consider all situations, especially some border conditions.
