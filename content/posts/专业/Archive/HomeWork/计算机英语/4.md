The most important feature of a program developer is a editor that has a cool style. We look at codes all day long, so font of codes is often overlooked but vital for the coding experience. This article emphasizes the importance of code fonts.

A good code font will help you find typos, variables and functions quickly. Code highlighting makes developers more efficient.

Companies which design IDE usually have their own code font. For example, Jetbrains Mono. It has a higher height, makes code easier to recognize. And it has some useful ligatures to identify special characters (though I don't really like it). Each character is distinct, 1, l and I is easy to read, while they look the same with a lot of standard fonts.
