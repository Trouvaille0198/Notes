https://dev.to/ben/what-are-your-tips-for-an-effective-developer-resume-ep4

This is not a traditional article, it's like a discussion in forums. Many developers left their wise advise in this posting. The subject is *What are your tips for an effective developer resumé*. It helps me a lot because I happen to be looking for an internship as well. Here are some suggestions that I have benefited from.

Don’t list every technology you have ever done “hello world” in. Just list the knowledge and skills that you are really good at and that fit the target position. You will never be expert of every field.

Make sure to link to your socials. Especially GitHub, this is the perfect platform to showcase yourself.

Try and showcase how well you will perform in a team. Try to tailor the descriptions of your project experience to match the job you are applying for.
